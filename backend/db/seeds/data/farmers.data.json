We employ natural pest control by maintaining habitat for local raptors and insects, drastically reducing the need for chemical intervention. Every harvest is meticulously hand-sorted to ensure premium quality, reflecting our belief that the most challenging environments yield the most concentrated flavors and resilient crops.
